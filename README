This software is an initiave of members of student badminton club SB Helios.
The ultimate goal will be a public availeble swiss system tournament management software package.

Development started in the fall of 2012.
First tests are done and the deadline for the first beta is set at the 30th of february.
A full operational version will be used at the ISBT Utrecht (facebook.com/isbtutrecht).

In the next years, the goal is to develop this software until it is ready to launch on the internet.
For now the focus will be on a operational version used on an internal network without any focus on security.
Expertise of a developer is needed to get the system up and running.
